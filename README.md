# Dog3

This awesome mobile application will serve as a scheduler and a work-hour counter.


# Description

The Dog mk3 will be an application suitable for the needs of a person that wants to excel and invest time in skills. Using a simple gamified concept the application will display the number of hours you have invested in these skills, showing you what you could work on and what you've done this week. I plan for the application to be multipurpose, allowing you to keep track of your spending habits and events or work-related items you'd like to remember.



# Homework related aspects
I'll have input forms for adding courses or skills you want to improve.
I'll have lists of skills with associated invested hours.
I'll display a chart with hours invested in a week & some more progress related charting.
I would like to implement a login system so that users can have their data stored on a server and access it from any device.
